Most of the cities, towns and villages in India are not well
designed to facilitate the suitable garbage collection methods.
• Common Public dustbins are filling over with the garbage and
no one is concerned to clear them up as and when they get
completely packed with overflowing garbage.
• Keeping in view of this big problem, it will be a good
suggestion to do something to deal with this unmanaged waste
and from this, the concept of ‘Smart Garbage’ came out.
